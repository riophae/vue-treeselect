### Getting Started

It's recommended to install vue-treeselect via npm, and build your app using a bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

```bash
npm install --save @riophae/vue-treeselect
```

This example shows how to integrate vue-treeselect with your [Vue SFCs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html).

```vue
<!-- Vue SFC -->
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <treeselect v-model="value" :multiple="true" :options="options" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  // import the component
  import Treeselect from '@riophae/vue-treeselect'
  // import the styles
  import '@riophae/vue-treeselect/dist/vue-treeselect.css'

  export default {
    // register the component
    components: { Treeselect },
    data() {
      return {
        // define the default value
        value: null,
        // define options
        options: [ {
          id: 'a',
          label: 'a',
          children: [ {
            id: 'aa',
            label: 'aa',
          }, {
            id: 'ab',
            label: 'ab',
          } ],
        }, {
          id: 'b',
          label: 'b',
        }, {
          id: 'c',
          label: 'c',
        } ],
      }
    },
  }
</script>
```

If you just don't want to use webpack or any other bundlers, you can simply include the standalone UMD build in your page. In this way, make sure Vue as a dependency is included before vue-treeselect.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- include Vue 2.x -->
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@^2"></script>
    <!-- include vue-treeselect & its styles. you can change the version tag to better suit your needs. -->
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@riophae/vue-treeselect@^0.4.0/dist/vue-treeselect.umd.min.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@riophae/vue-treeselect@^0.4.0/dist/vue-treeselect.min.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app">
      <treeselect v-model="value" :multiple="true" :options="options" />
    </div>
  </body>
  <script>
    // register the component
    Vue.component('treeselect', VueTreeselect.Treeselect)

    new Vue({
      el: '#app',
      data: {
        // define the default value
        value: null,
        // define options
        options: [ {
          id: 'a',
          label: 'a',
          children: [ {
            id: 'aa',
            label: 'aa',
          }, {
            id: 'ab',
            label: 'ab',
          } ],
        }, {
          id: 'b',
          label: 'b',
        }, {
          id: 'c',
          label: 'c',
        } ],
      },
    })
  </script>
</html>
```

### Documentation & Live Demo

[Visit the website](https://vue-treeselect.js.org/)

Note: please use a desktop browser since the website hasn't been optimized for mobile devices.

### Browser Compatibility

- Chrome
- Edge
- Firefox
- IE â‰¥ 9
- Safari

It should function well on IE9, but the style can be slightly broken due to the lack of support of some relatively new CSS features, such as `transition` and `animation`. Nevertheless it should look 90% same as on modern browsers.
