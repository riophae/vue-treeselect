    :multiple="true"
    :options="source"
    />
</template>

<script>
  import Treeselect from '@riophae/vue-treeselect'

  export default {
    components: { Treeselect },
    data: {
      value: null,
      source: [
        {
          id: 'node-1',
          label: 'Node 1',
          children: [
            {
              id: 'node-1-a',
              label: 'Node 1-A',
            },
            ...

### Documentation & Examples

[Visit the website](https://riophae.github.io/vue-treeselect)

Note: please use a desktop browser since the website hasn't been optimized for mobile devices.

### Browser Compatibility

- Chrome
- Edge
- Firefox
- IE â‰¥ 9
- Safari

It should function well on IE9, but the style can be slightly broken due to the lack of support of some relatively new CSS features, such as `transition` and `animation`. Nevertheless it should look 90% same as on modern browsers.
