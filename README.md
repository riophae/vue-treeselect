# vue-treeselect
> A multi-select component with nested options support for Vue.js

#### Why fork ?
Add some new requirements :
- Improve search performance
- Add `selectionable` option on nodes
- Open treeselect in the right place

### Features

- Single & multiple select with nested options support
- Fuzzy matching
- Async searching
- Delayed loading (load data of deep level options only when needed)
- Keyboard support (navigate using <kbd>Arrow Up</kbd> & <kbd>Arrow Down</kbd> keys, select option using <kbd>Enter</kbd> key, etc.)
- Rich options & highly customizable
- Supports a wide range of browsers (see [below](#browser-compatibility))
- RTL support

*Requires Vue 2.2+*

### Getting Started

It's recommended to install vue-treeselect via npm, and build your app using a bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

```bash
npm install --save @unifai/vue-treeselect
```

### Publish new version of package
1. Edit `package.json` and increase version name
2. Build package `npm run finish`
3. After login to npm, `npm publish --access=public`

That's it !

### Documentation & Live Demo

[Visit the website](https://vue-treeselect.js.org/)

Note: please use a desktop browser since the website hasn't been optimized for mobile devices.

### Browser Compatibility

- Chrome
- Edge
- Firefox
- IE ≥ 9
- Safari

It should function well on IE9, but the style can be slightly broken due to the lack of support of some relatively new CSS features, such as `transition` and `animation`. Nevertheless it should look 90% same as on modern browsers.
