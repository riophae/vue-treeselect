+guide('Basic Features')

    This example demonstrates the most commonly-used features of vue-treeselect. Try the fuzzy-searching functionality by typing a few letters.
  +demo('BasicFeatures')
  :markdown-it
    The first thing you need to learn is how to define options. There are two types of options: **(a) folder options** that are foldable & may have children options, and **(b) normal options** that aren't & don't. Here, I'd like to borrow the basic concepts from Computer Science and call the former as **branch nodes** and the latter as **leaf nodes**. These two kinds of nodes together compose the tree.

    Defining leaf nodes is quite simple:

    ```js
    {
      id: '<id>', // used to identify the option within the tree so it's value must be unique across all options
      label: '<label>', // used to display the option
    }
    ```

    Defining branch nodes only needs an extra `children` property:

    ```js
    {
      id: '<id>',
      label: '<label>',
      children: [
        {
          id: '<child id>',
          label: '<child label>',
        },
        ...
      ],
    }
    ```

    Then you can pass an array of these nodes as the `options` prop.

    :markdown-it(inline)
      Note that, because a complex state tree needs to be maintained internally, vue-treeselect will copy `options` and will not react to the changes of the original array. In other words, directly modify `options` **will not** work as expected. If children options needs to be dynamically loaded, see [below](#delayed-loading).

    This demonstrates more features.

+guide('Delayed Loading')
  :markdown-it
    If you have a large number of deeply nested options, you might want to load options only of the most top levels on initial load and load the rest only when needed. You can achieve that by following these steps:

      1. Declare an *unloaded* branch node by setting `children: null` or `isBranch: true`
      2. Provide a `loadChildrenOptions` prop
      3. Whenever an unloaded branch node gets expanded, `loadChildrenOptions(parentNode, callback)` will be called within which the job requesting data from remote server could be performed
  +demo('DelayedLoading')
  :markdown-it
    If you want the root level options to be delayed loaded as well, omit the `options` prop and provide an extra `loadRootOptions` prop. By default, vue-treeselect will try loading root options by calling `loadRootOptions(callback)` after the component is mounted. In this example I have disabled that feature, and root options will be loaded when the menu is opened.
  +demo('DelayedRootOptions')

+guide('Flat Mode & Sort Values')
  :markdown-it
    In all previous examples, we used the default non-flat mode of vue-treeselect, which means:

      1. Whenever a branch node gets checked, all its children will be checked too
      2. Whenever a branch node has all children checked, the branch node itself will be checked too

    Sometimes we don't need that mechanism, and want branch nodes and leaf nodes don't affect each other. In this case, flat mode should be used, as demonstrated in the following.

    If you want to control the order in which selected options to be displayed, use the `sortValueBy` prop.
  +demo('FlatModeAndSortValues')

+guide('Disable Branch Nodes')
  :markdown-it
    Set `disableBranchNodes` to `true` to prevent branch nodes from being selected. You may also want to show a count next to the label of each branch node by setting `showCount` to `true`.
  +demo('DisableBranchNodes')

+guide('Customize Option Label')
  :markdown-it
    You can customize the label of each option. vue-treeselect utilizes Vue's [scoped slot](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#Scoped-Slots) feature and provides some props you should use in your customized template:

    - `node` - a normalized node object
    - `count` & `shouldShowCount` - the count number and a boolean indicates whether the count should be displayed
    - `labelClassName` & `countClassName` - CSS classnames for making the style correct
  +demo('CustomizeOptionLabel')

+guide('Vuex Support')
  :markdown-it
      In all previous examples, we used `v-model` to sync value between application state and vue-treeselect, a.k.a two-way data binding. If you are using Vuex, we could make use of `:value` and `@input`, since `v-model` is just a syntax sugur for them in Vue 2.

      Concretely speaking, we can bind `getter` to `:value` to make vue-treeselect reflect any changes in your Vuex state, and bind `action` or `mutation` to `@input` to update your Vuex state whenever the value changes.
  +demo('VuexSupport')

+guide('Disable Item Selection')
  :markdown-it
      You can disable item selection by setting a `disabled` property to your model item. This property is false by default.
